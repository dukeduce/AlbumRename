This project provides a simple script for renaming album folders to "artist - album (year)".
This project uses The taglib library to read song metadata and does not alter or add song metadata, or song file names.
Album Rename supports unicode folder names, and tags.


## Usage

Place the executable `AlbumRename.exe` in the directory of your album folders and open the script.
